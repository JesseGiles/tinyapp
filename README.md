# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). Create, edit and delete functionality for shortening URLs is limited to registered, logged-in users; however all users are free to utilize the TinyApp URL links in browser via:

### localhost:8080/u/:id (substitute :id with the specific TinyApp URL id)
